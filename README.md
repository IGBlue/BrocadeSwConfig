# BrocadeSwConfig
Brocade SAN switch helper programs

This project is a set of three programs designed to help configure Brocade Fibrechannel switches.

A considerable amount of detailed work is required to define the alias, zone and configuratiion of these switches, particularly for new installations. The documentation describes the philosphy behind the programs and how they can be used to minimise errors when configuring the switches as well as reducing the amount of time required.

Examples, taken from working environments, are provided to aid understanding.

The programs are written in Python and a prerequite is that Python is installed. Development was done under Windows.

Full documentation is available in the BrocadeSwitches PDF or DOCX files. I ti suggested that these be used to evaluate suitablilty.

The ZIP file contains all the files in the project repository for ease of download.

Note that Brocade switches are very often OEMd by other computer companies which include HPE, Dell and IBM.
